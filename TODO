## Things to do ##

# Tips from Evgeni #
 - Check all matrix copying, numpy and scipy copy by reference
 - Fix all random seeds

# Dataset # 
 - Improve data structure for data-sets, 
   Evgeni suggested Scipy sparse matrices
 - Nice to have: Implement dataset splitting
 - Nice to have: Implement dataset shuffling
   For simplicity remove the current shuffling

# Test #
 - Implement performance statistics, 
   precision, recall, F1 measure, confusion matrix.
  
# Train #
 - Debug the CVM algorithm
 - Nice to have: some other form of parallel training, maybe 
   parallel python http://www.parallelpython.com/ or
   just use os threads or processes.
 - Nice to have: allow for a choice between One-vs-All and One-vs-One
   classification

# Main #
 - Commandline tool: write better usage instructions
